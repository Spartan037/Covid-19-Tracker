# Covid-19-Tracker

<h2>COVID-19 Tracker</h2>
<br>While the COVID-19 outbreak was reported to first originate from
Wuhan, China, it has been declared as a Public Health Emergency of
International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 by WHO, and it has
spread to over 180 countries. As the disease spreads around the globe,
it has evolved into a worldwide pandemic, endangering the state of
global public health and becoming a serious threat to the global
community.
To combat and prevent the spread of the disease, all individuals should
be well-informed of the rapidly changing state of COVID-19. In the
endeavour of accomplishing this objective, a COVID-19 real-time
analytical tracker should be built to provide the latest status of the
disease and relevant analytical insights.
